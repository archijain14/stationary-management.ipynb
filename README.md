My name is Archi Jain. It gives me immense pleasure to present before you all my First Inventory Management project called as "stationary management". It mainly includes the basic details of our day-to-day required stationary products , their adding,their sales, purchase, etc. Also after purchasing number of stationary products ,the code will help in generating the customized bill receipt.  I have learnt a lot from this project and it was really a great experience for me.
